            Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers.
            Physicist Richard Feynman, the father of nanotechnology.
            Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering.
            The ideas and concepts behind nanoscience and nanotechnology started with a talk entitled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) on December 29, 1959, long before the term nanotechnology was used. In his talk, Feynman described a process in which scientists would be able to manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. Over a decade later, in his explorations of ultraprecision machining, Professor Norio Taniguchi coined the term nanotechnology. It wasn't until 1981, with the development of the scanning tunneling microscope that could "see" individual atoms, that modern nanotechnology began.

            The 3D XPoint is a solid-state drive that is getting buzz for its breakneck speeds in accessing memory. The technology is the marriage of RAM and flash storage, as it's four times denser than traditional RAM. Conveniently, it can hold information even when it's turned off, unlike other volatile storage sources. When compared to other forms of information storage, like NAND and DRAM, 3D XPoint is almost 1,000 times faster at reading and writing information. This means the new-generation memory technology will power the next series of computers. The Optane SSD DC P4800X will be Intel's first foray with the new tech.  The 375 GB solid-state drive comes at a cost of $1520. Intel's second product to use the technology will come at a much more affordable cost at $44, equipped with a 16 GB memory solution.

            <div class="ft1"> Travel & Navigation
                <p class="para">We might have used navigation services or others to find our way through at some point in our lives. For many, it is part of their daily lives. Whether using maps for navigation or using a taxi-hire service like Uber, you are using AI-enabled services to travel from one place to another.
                    Google, Apple, and many other navigation-related service providers utilize AI to interpret the scores of information being received and provide you with information that helps in navigation and get live traffic updates, allowing you to commute more efficiently.
                    There are plenty of Geocoding and Maps API available to convert an idea into reality.</p>

            <div class="ft2">Smartphone Apps
            <p class="para">Imagining our lives without mobile phones does sound to be a challenge. Different applications on our mobiles have become an integral part of our daily lives. Many of these applications are based on AI.
                Smart Speakers, Google Home
                Built-in smart assistants on our phones like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant are the more obvious examples of AI that most of us are aware of and use.
                More mobile technology platforms are developing solutions that use AI for managing different aspects of the device like battery management, event suggestions, etc. One of the standard features, like using a portrait mode on the phone, also uses AI. 
                AI-enabled services are now a significant part of the updates on both iOS and Android platforms.</p>

            <div class="ft3">Social Media Feeds
                <p class="para">Check out applications on your smartphones to feel the presence of AI within various social media apps. Whether it is your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other platforms, what you see and do on these applications is, to a large extent, influenced by machine learning. AI controls the feeds that you get to see while browsing through these platforms or the notifications you receive.
                    It takes into consideration your tastes & preferences, your history, and imprint on SM, etc., to curate the information to transmit feeds that you find more relevant and are inclined to see.</p>
