            Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers.
            Physicist Richard Feynman, the father of nanotechnology.
            Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering.
            The ideas and concepts behind nanoscience and nanotechnology started with a talk entitled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) on December 29, 1959, long before the term nanotechnology was used. In his talk, Feynman described a process in which scientists would be able to manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. Over a decade later, in his explorations of ultraprecision machining, Professor Norio Taniguchi coined the term nanotechnology. It wasn't until 1981, with the development of the scanning tunneling microscope that could "see" individual atoms, that modern nanotechnology began.

            The 3D XPoint is a solid-state drive that is getting buzz for its breakneck speeds in accessing memory. The technology is the marriage of RAM and flash storage, as it's four times denser than traditional RAM. Conveniently, it can hold information even when it's turned off, unlike other volatile storage sources. When compared to other forms of information storage, like NAND and DRAM, 3D XPoint is almost 1,000 times faster at reading and writing information. This means the new-generation memory technology will power the next series of computers. The Optane SSD DC P4800X will be Intel's first foray with the new tech.  The 375 GB solid-state drive comes at a cost of $1520. Intel's second product to use the technology will come at a much more affordable cost at $44, equipped with a 16 GB memory solution.
